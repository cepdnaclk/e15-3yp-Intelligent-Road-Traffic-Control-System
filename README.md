## Introduction

Vehicle travel across the world is increasing, especially in larger urban areas. It is a serious problem in traffic congestions in many major cities around the world and in these cities, it has become a nightmare for travelers. Since Traditional systems have implemented to follow a preset time schedule, they do not control variable flows coming near junctions.
There is a goal of customizing traffic flow vehicles in a junction. As the number of roads increases steadily, and the resources provided by the current infrastructure are limited, intelligent control of traffic in the future will become a very important issue. Therefore, to better accommodation of this increasing demand, traffic control algorithms need to be simulated and optimized.  
#### “One study done in Boston has proved the timings of 60 intersections in one district of the city could save $1.2 million per year”
